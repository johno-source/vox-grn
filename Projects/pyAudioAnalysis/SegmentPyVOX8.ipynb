    "The group of notebooks SegmentPyVOXn.ipynb (n=0-9) will be used to segment the data using the segmentation algorithm I developed in DevelopASSegmentation.ipynb. It follows the same pattern as used in SegmentFVOXn.ipynb.\n",

    "Three sets of data will be made, 4, 6, and 10 second data. \n",

    "This file will take a long time to run. For that reason it will check point its progress at regular intervals by writing smaller files. If its progress is restarted for any reason it will use those files to determine where it was up to. Segmenting the data is the slow part. For each audio file a segment file will be generated. If mp3 files are to be generated later using different parameters the segmented files should make the process much quicker.\n",
